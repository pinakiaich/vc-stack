## üí° Tips for Your Search

### If Using AI Mode (with OpenAI API Key):
- Use **Version 1 (Comprehensive)** or **Version 4 (Detailed)**
- AI understands context and can interpret:
  - "$5M+" means "5 million or more"
  - "B2B only" excludes consumer companies
  - "Top-tier VCs" knows major VC firms
  - "CVC" means corporate venture capital

### If Using Keyword Matching Mode (no API Key):
- Use **Version 3 (Keyword-Optimized)**
- Include variations of key terms:
  - "AI, artificial intelligence, machine learning"
  - "$5M, $10M, $20M" (catches various revenue levels)
  - "VC, venture capital, CVC, corporate venture"
- More keywords = better matching
