# 🔧 FIXED: Column Detection & API Error Display

## Issues Fixed

### Issue 1: Wrong Column Selected for Names
**Problem:** 
- File has both "companies" (312 filled) and "name" (58 filled) columns
- App was using "name" (only 58/312 filled)
- Should use "companies" (312/312 filled)

**Fix:**
- Column mapping now picks the column with **MOST data**
- "companies" (312 filled) > "name" (58 filled)
- Will use "companies" automatically!

---

### Issue 2: Hidden API Errors
**Problem:**
- VC Expert fails but shows generic message
- Actual error hidden
- Can't diagnose if it's quota, rate limit, or other issue

**Fix:**
- **Shows actual API error in UI** (in red code block)
- **Full error trace in terminal/console**
- Can now see exact error message from OpenAI

---

## 🚀 What Changed

### 1. **Smart Column Selection** (`data_processor.py`)

**Before:**
```python
# Found "name" column first → uses it (even if only 58/312 filled)
df['name'] = df['name']  # 58 filled
```

**After:**
```python
# Checks ALL matching columns:
# - "companies": 312/312 filled ✓ 
# - "name": 58/312 filled
# 
# Picks "companies" because it has MORE data!
df['name'] = df['companies']  # 312 filled ✓
```

### 2. **Error Message Display** (`streamlit_app.py`, `ai_filter.py`)

**Before:**
```
❌ VC Expert Failed - Fell back to keyword matching
Possible reasons: Invalid API key, no credits, rate limit...
```

**After:**
```
❌ VC Expert Failed - Fell back to keyword matching

Error: RateLimitError: Error code: 429 - You exceeded your current quota

Now you can see the **EXACT error** from OpenAI!

## 🎯 What You'll See After Restart
