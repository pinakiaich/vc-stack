# üéØ Comprehensive Analysis with ALL Data Fields

## Issues Fixed

### Issue 1: Duplicate Column Names Error
**Problem:** Excel file had duplicate columns causing processing to fail  
**Fix:** Automatic handling of duplicates by adding suffix (e.g., "growth rate 2")

### Issue 2: Limited Data Analysis
**Problem:** VC Expert only saw 6 basic fields (name, description, industry, stage, revenue, location)  
**Fix:** Now analyzes ALL 80+ columns including growth rates, financing data, investor info, success probabilities, etc.
