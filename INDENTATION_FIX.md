# âœ… Indentation Error Fixed!

## **Problem**
```
IndentationError: expected an indented block after 'with' statement on line 237
```

## **Root Cause**
The `try:` block was not properly indented under the `with st.spinner():` statement.

## **Fix Applied**
- Fixed indentation for the entire `try:` block
- Ensured all nested code is properly indented
- Maintained proper Python syntax structure

## **Files Modified**
- `streamlit_app.py` - Fixed indentation for the filtering logic

## **Test Result**
âœ… **Syntax check passed** - No more indentation errors

---

## **ðŸš€ Ready to Test**

The app should now run without indentation errors. Try:

```bash
cd "/Users/pinakiaich/Documents/Personal/Python Projects/vc-stack"
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```

**Expected behavior:**
- âœ… No more IndentationError
- âœ… VC Expert Agent processes companies in batches
- âœ… Real company names displayed
- âœ… Professional VC analysis with specific data points

---

**The token limit issue is also fixed with batch processing!** ðŸŽ¯
