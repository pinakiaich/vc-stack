# 🔧 FIXED: Metadata Rows Issue

## Your Problem
Results showed metadata and IDs instead of company names:
- "Downloaded on:"
- "Created for:"  
- "Search Link:"
- "466959-97" (IDs)

## ✅ What I Fixed

### 1. Auto-Detection (`data_processor.py`)
- **Detects header row** automatically
- **Skips metadata rows** like "Downloaded on:", "Created for:"
- **Removes ID-only rows** like "466959-97", "59199-40"
- **Filters out invalid data** (too short, empty, etc.)

### 2. Manual Control (`streamlit_app.py`)
- **New "Skip metadata rows" option** in UI
- **Data validation warnings** if data looks wrong
- **Better error messages** with actionable steps

### 3. Documentation
- **EXCEL_FORMAT_GUIDE.md** - Complete guide to fixing Excel files
- **Examples and troubleshooting** for common issues

## 🚀 How to Fix Your Issue RIGHT NOW

### Option 1: Just Re-Upload (Easiest)
The app now auto-detects and removes metadata rows:

1. Run the app: `streamlit run streamlit_app.py`
2. Upload your Excel file again
3. ✅ It should now show actual company names!

### Option 2: Manual Skip (If auto-detect fails)
If you still see metadata in results:

1. Open "**⚙️ Advanced: Skip metadata rows**" (below file upload)
2. Count how many rows before your data starts in Excel
3. Enter that number (e.g., 5, 6, 7...)
4. Upload file again

### Option 3: Clean Your Excel File (Best long-term)
Clean the Excel file once, use forever:

1. Open your Excel file
2. Delete metadata rows at the top (rows with "Downloaded on:", etc.)
3. Delete or move the "Company ID" column to the end
4. Make sure first row has: `Company Name | Description | Industry | ...`
5. Save and upload

## 🎯 Quick Test

After uploading, check these:

1. **Click "📊 View Uploaded Data"**
   - Do the names look like real companies?
   - Not IDs or metadata?

2. **Check "Data Summary"**
   - Does "Total Firms" make sense?

3. **Try filtering**
   - Use your heuristics
   - Should now show actual companies!
