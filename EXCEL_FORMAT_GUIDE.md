## Your Issue: Metadata Rows Being Read as Company Names

### What Happened
Your Excel file has metadata rows at the top (like "Downloaded on:", "Created for:", "Search Link:", etc.) that were being read as company data.

### ‚úÖ Fixed!
The app now:
1. **Auto-detects** metadata rows and skips them
2. **Removes** rows that look like metadata or IDs
3. **Validates** that data looks like actual companies
4. **Warns** you if something looks wrong

---

## üéØ Ideal Excel Format

Your Excel file should have:

### Row 1: Column Headers
```
| Company Name | Description | Industry | Stage | Revenue | Valuation | Investors | Location |
```

### Row 2+: Company Data
```
| Acme AI Corp | Enterprise AI platform... | Artificial Intelligence | Series B | $10M ARR | $250M | Sequoia, a16z | San Francisco |
| TechCo Inc   | Machine learning SaaS...  | AI/ML                   | Series C | $15M ARR | $300M | Accel, GV    | New York      |
```

## üö´ Common Problems & Solutions

### Problem 1: Metadata Rows at Top

**Your file looks like:**
```
Downloaded on: 2024-10-19
Created for: John Doe
Search Link: https://...
Search Criteria: AI companies

Company Name | Description | Industry | ...
Acme AI Corp | Enterprise... | AI       | ...
```

**Solution:** 
‚úÖ **The app now auto-removes these!** Just re-upload your file.

If auto-detection doesn't work:
1. Open "‚öôÔ∏è Advanced: Skip metadata rows"
2. Count how many metadata rows are at the top (e.g., 4 rows)
3. Enter that number
4. Re-process

---

### Problem 2: ID Numbers as Company Names

**Your results show:**
```
1. 466959-97
2. 59199-40
3. 63690-94
```

**This means:**
- These are company IDs, not names
- The "Company Name" column might be missing
- Or IDs are in the first column

**Solution:**
1. Open your Excel file
2. Make sure "Company Name" or "Name" is the **first column**
3. If you have an ID column, move it to the right
4. Re-upload

**Or manually fix in Excel:**
- Delete the ID column, OR
- Move company names to the first column

---

### Problem 3: Wrong Column Order

**App expects this order (flexible, but helpful):**
```
Name ‚Üí Description ‚Üí Industry ‚Üí Stage ‚Üí Revenue ‚Üí Valuation ‚Üí Investors ‚Üí Location
```

**Your file might have:**
```
ID ‚Üí Search Link ‚Üí Company Name ‚Üí Description ‚Üí ...
```

**Solution:**
1. Re-arrange columns in Excel
2. Put "Company Name" or "Name" as **first column**
3. Put important fields (Description, Industry) early
4. Re-upload

## üîß Using the "Skip Rows" Feature

### When to Use:
- You see metadata like "Downloaded on:" in results
- Company IDs show up as names
- First few results don't look like companies

### How to Use:

1. **Click "‚öôÔ∏è Advanced: Skip metadata rows"**

2. **Count metadata rows in your Excel:**
   - Open your Excel file
   - Count rows before the actual header row
   - Example:
     ```
     Row 1: Downloaded on: 2024-10-19    ‚Üê metadata
     Row 2: Created for: User            ‚Üê metadata  
     Row 3: (empty)                      ‚Üê metadata
     Row 4: Company Name | Description   ‚Üê THIS IS THE HEADER
     Row 5: Acme Corp | AI platform      ‚Üê actual data
     ```
   - In this example, skip **3 rows** (rows 1-3)

3. **Enter the number** in "Number of rows to skip"

4. **Re-process** - Upload button will reset, upload again

---

## ‚ú® New Auto-Detection Features

The app now automatically:

### 1. Finds Header Row
- Searches for rows with keywords: "name", "company", "firm", "description"
- Skips rows with: "downloaded", "created", "search", "criteria"

### 2. Removes Metadata Rows
- Filters out rows like "Downloaded on:", "Created for:"
- Removes rows with ID patterns (e.g., "466959-97")
- Removes very short names (< 3 characters)

### 3. Validates Data
- Checks if data looks like company names
- Warns if something seems wrong
- Shows data quality metrics

## üéØ Quick Fix for Your Current File

Based on your error, your Excel file likely looks like this:

```excel
Row 1: Downloaded on: [date]
Row 2: Created for: [name]  
Row 3: Search Link: [url]
Row 4: Search Criteria: [criteria]
Row 5: 
Row 6: Company ID | Company Name | Description | Industry | ...

2. Enter **6** (skip first 6 rows)

2. Delete rows 1-5 (metadata rows)
3. Delete "Company ID" column (or move it to the end)

5. Save and re-upload

## üîç Verifying Your Data

After uploading, **always check**:

1. **Click "üìä View Uploaded Data"**

2. **Look at "First 5 rows":**
   - Do these look like real company names?
   - Is the data in the right columns?

3. **Check "Data Summary":**
   - Does "Total Firms" make sense?
   - Do you have descriptions and industries?

4. **Review "Available Columns":**
   - Are all your columns listed?
   - Are column names correct?

## üìû Still Having Issues?

### Check These:

1. **File Format:**
   - Is it really .xlsx or .xls?
   - Not .csv renamed to .xlsx?

2. **Data Quality:**
   - Are company names present?
   - Is there actual text in Description?
   - Are columns labeled?

3. **File Size:**
   - Files with 1000s of companies might be slow
   - Try a smaller sample first

4. **Excel Versions:**
   - Modern Excel formats work best
   - If very old file, try opening and re-saving

### Debug Mode:

1. Upload file
2. Check "üìä View Uploaded Data"
3. Look at what actually loaded
4. Adjust "Skip rows" if needed
5. Try again
