# 🎯 Automatic Header Detection & Cleaning

## Issue Resolved
**Problem:** "Can't detect company name" - Excel files with metadata rows or unusual column names weren't being parsed correctly.

**Solution:** Automatic header row detection and column name cleaning before analysis.

---

## ✅ What's Been Added

### 1. **Intelligent Header Row Detection**
The app now automatically finds the real header row by:
- Scanning first 30 rows
- Skipping metadata rows ("Downloaded on:", "Created for:", etc.)
- Finding row with most column-like cells
- Looking for company-related keywords ("company", "name", "companies", etc.)

**Example:**
```
Row 1: Downloaded on: 2024-10-19          ← Skipped (metadata)
Row 2: Created for: User                   ← Skipped (metadata)
Row 3: Search: AI companies                ← Skipped (metadata)
Row 4: (empty)                             ← Skipped (empty)
Row 5: companies | growth rate | desc...   ← DETECTED AS HEADER! ✓
Row 6: Acme Corp | 15% | AI platform...    ← First data row
```

### 2. **Automatic Column Name Cleaning**
Cleans column headers before processing:
- Removes special characters (#, %, $, etc.)
- Standardizes spaces and underscores
- Converts to lowercase
- Removes extra whitespace

**Example:**
```
Before: "Company_Name#1", "Growth Rate %", "Primary Industry Sector"
After:  "company name 1",  "growth rate",   "primary industry sector"
```

### 3. **Expanded Column Name Recognition**
Now detects MORE variations:

**For Company Name:**
- name, company, **companies** ✨ (NEW!)
- company name, firm, organization
- business name, firm name, **portfolio company** ✨ (NEW!)

**For Other Fields:**
- industry → sector, vertical, **primary industry** ✨
- revenue → arr, sales, **total revenue** ✨
- location → hq, headquarters, **geography** ✨

### 4. **Better Safety Checks**
- Won't remove >50% of rows if column detection fails
- Shows warnings when too much data would be removed
- Provides clear guidance on using Manual Column Mapping

## 🚀 How It Works Now

### Before Upload:
```
Your Excel:
- Row 1-4: Metadata/headers
- Row 5: Column headers (companies, growth rate, description...)
- Row 6+: Data
```

### During Processing:
```
Step 1: Auto-detect header row → Found at Row 5 ✓
Step 2: Skip rows 1-4 (metadata)
Step 3: Use Row 5 as headers
Step 4: Clean column names:
  "companies" → "companies" (maps to 'name')
  "Growth Rate %" → "growth rate"
  "Primary Industry Sector" → "primary industry sector" (maps to 'industry')
Step 5: Map to standard columns:
  'companies' → detected as 'name' ✓
  'primary industry sector' → detected as 'industry' ✓
Step 6: Load data from Row 6+
```

### Result:
```
✅ Loaded 309 firms from Excel
✅ name: Found ✓ (309/312 filled)
✅ description: Found ✓ (309/312 filled)
✅ industry: Found ✓ (305/312 filled)
```
