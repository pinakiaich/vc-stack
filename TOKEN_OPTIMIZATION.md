# ðŸ”§ Token Limit Optimization Applied

## **Problem**
```
BadRequestError: Error code: 400 - This model's maximum context length is 16385 tokens. 
However, you requested 17077 tokens (14077 in the messages, 3000 in the completion).
```

## **Root Cause**
Even with batching, 15 companies Ã— 79 data fields was still too much data.

## **Optimizations Applied**

### 1. **Reduced Batch Size**
- **Before:** 15 companies per batch
- **After:** 5 companies per batch
- **Result:** Much smaller token usage per API call

### 2. **Reduced Max Tokens**
- **Before:** 3000 tokens for completion
- **After:** 2000 tokens for completion
- **Result:** More room for input data

### 3. **Selective Data Fields**
- **Before:** All 79 fields sent to AI
- **After:** Only key investment fields:
  - Revenue, Growth Rate, Total Raised
  - Active Investors, First Financing Valuation
  - Success Probability, Employees, Year Founded
  - Business Status, Primary Industry Sector

### 4. **Data Truncation**
- **Before:** Full field values (up to 100 chars)
- **After:** Truncated to 50 chars max
- **Result:** Significantly reduced token usage

## **Expected Results**

âœ… **No more token limit errors**
âœ… **Faster processing** (smaller batches)
âœ… **Still comprehensive analysis** (key fields preserved)
âœ… **Professional VC reasoning** maintained

## **ðŸš€ Test Now**

The app should now work without token limit errors:

```bash
cd "/Users/pinakiaich/Documents/Personal/Python Projects/vc-stack"
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```

**Expected behavior:**
- âœ… Processes companies in batches of 5
- âœ… No token limit errors
- âœ… Professional VC analysis with key metrics
- âœ… Real company names displayed

---

**The token optimization should resolve the context length issue!** ðŸŽ¯
