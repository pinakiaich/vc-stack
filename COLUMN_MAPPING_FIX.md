# 🔧 FIXED: Empty Company Names Issue

## Your Problem
Results showing empty names like `**1. **` with "No keyword matches"

This means the company name column wasn't detected/mapped correctly.

---

## ✅ What I Just Fixed

### 1. **Enhanced Column Detection** (`data_processor.py`)
- **Expanded search patterns**: Now looks for "company", "company name", "firm", "organization", "business name", etc.
- **Fuzzy matching**: Can find columns even with slightly different names
- **Better fallback**: Uses first column as company name if no match found
- **Detailed logging**: Shows which columns got mapped

### 2. **Visual Column Debugging** (`streamlit_app.py`)
- **Column Detection Status**: Shows which columns were found (✅ / ⚠️ / ❌)
- **All Columns Display**: Lists every column in your file
- **Data Preview**: Shows first 5 rows with actual data
- **Expanded by default**: Automatically opens so you see what's loaded

### 3. **Manual Column Mapping** (`streamlit_app.py`)
- **New Feature**: Manually select which column has company names
- **Located in**: "⚙️ Advanced Options" → "Manual Column Mapping"
- **Dropdown selector**: Choose from all your columns
- **Real-time feedback**: Shows which column you're using

## 📊 Example Scenarios

**Solution:**
1. Open "Advanced Options"

### Scenario 2: Company Names in Wrong Column

**Your Excel has:**
```

2. Select "company_details" in Manual Column Mapping
3. ✅ Real names appear!

## 🎯 Understanding the Column Detection

### What It Looks For:

**For 'name' column, it searches for:**
- name
- company
- company name
- firm
- organization
- business name
- company_name

**For 'description' column:**
- description
- desc
- about
- summary
- overview

**For 'industry' column:**
- industry
- sector
- vertical
- category
- market

And so on for other columns.

## 🔍 How to Verify It's Working

After uploading, check:

### 1. **Column Detection Status**
All key columns should show ✅ or at least ⚠️ (not ❌)

### 2. **First 5 Rows Table**
Look at the data:
- Does the "name" column have real company names?
- Are other columns populated?

### 3. **Try Filtering**
- Enter simple heuristics like "AI technology"
- Results should show actual company names, not empty or IDs

## 💡 Pro Tips

### Tip 1: Always Check "View Uploaded Data"
This section is now **expanded by default** - always review it!

### Tip 2: Look at "All Columns"
Shows exactly what column names are in your file - use these for manual mapping

### Tip 3: Use Manual Mapping for Non-Standard Files
If your company names are in columns like:
- "organization_name"
- "firm_name"
- "portfolio_company"
- etc.

Just select it manually!

### Tip 4: Combine Solutions
You can use BOTH:
- Skip metadata rows (to remove header junk)
- Manual column mapping (to select right column)

## 🆘 Still Not Working?

If you still see empty names:

1. **Share your column names** (from "All Columns" section)
2. **Check your Excel** - does it actually have company names?
3. **Try manual mapping** with each column until you find the right one
4. **Check skip rows** - maybe metadata is still being included

The new diagnostic tools will help you figure out exactly what's wrong!
